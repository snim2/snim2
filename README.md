I'm a Service Lead at [dxw](https://www.dxw.com/), an employee-owned digital agency that works with the public and third sectors.

Before joining [dxw](https://www.dxw.com/), I was CTO at [Beautiful Canoe](https://beautifulcanoe.com/), a software house at [Aston University](https://www2.aston.ac.uk/eas/about-eas/academic-groups/computer-science ) where we hire out students and early career developers to work on client projects.
I'm also a Fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/).

Before [Beautiful Canoe](https://beautifulcanoe.com/) I was an RA at [KCL](https://soft-dev.org/) working on visualising JIT optimisations, measuring JIT performance and AST-level differencing tools.
Before that I was a Senior Lecturer in Computer Science at [Wolverhampton](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/) and [Coventry](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/) universities.
